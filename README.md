:computer: About Nannan

Nan_nan is a senoir computational scientist. Before she switched her career track to HPC domian from science domain, her research area was utilizing both first-principles-based simulations (e.g. DFT and ab initio MD) and experiments to accelerate the functional materials discovery and innovation in the fields of surface science, catalysis and energy production and storage.

Equipped with broad scientific knowledge and hands-on experience in Chemistry, Chemical Engineering and Materials Science, Nan_nan is now devoting her passion to high performance computing (HPC) user support. She dedicates herself to advancing the scientific research through  HPC techniques.
