# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my learning channel! 

I never thought I would learn coding/programming. I am using developed software/apps all the time, although my research need to be done with some linux commands which I think are easy to handle. With the complexity (fancy) of my research increase, I began to learn to read some python, c++, and fortran codes, sometimes matlab or mathmatica codes as well. I still do not need to write my own code. :wink:

Suddenly (I literally mean it) machine learning/AI is everywhere. I know if I want to continue staying in my current field, the research related field, I should start to learn coding. :sunglasses: 

I have noticed that many data scientists are using github intensively, so I am here too! :v:

:computer: About Nannan

Nannan's research area was utilizing both first-principles-based simulations (e.g. DFT and ab initio MD) and experiments to accelerate the functional materials discovery and innovation in the fields of surface science, catalysis and energy production and storage.

Equipped with broad scientific knowledge and hands-on experience in Chemistry, Chemical Engineering and Materials Science, Nannan is now devoting her passion to supporting users of RCAC community clusters and XSEDE Anvil cluster at Purdue. She dedicates herself to advancing the scientific research through high performance computing (HPC) techniques with scientists at Purdue and nationwide institutions.
