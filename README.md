# About Nannan
Nannans research area was utilizing both first-principles-based simulations (e.g. DFT and ab initio MD) and experiments to accelerate the functional materials discovery and innovation in the fields of surface science, catalysis and energy production and storage.

Equipped with broad scientific knowledge and hands-on experience in Chemistry, Chemical Engineering and Materials Science, Nannan is now devoting her passion to supporting users of RCAC community clusters and XSEDE Anvil cluster at Purdue. She dedicates herself to advancing the scientific research through high performance computing (HPC) techniques with scientists at Purdue and nationwide institutions.
